Given 2 strings A(m) and B(n), find the smallest substring of B having all the characters of A, in any order.

1) brute force generate all substrings, for each substring take it as new string and search for all charcaters in A.

       n*n ( n + nm), n
       n* n = substring generation
       n = copy array - as there may be duplicates in String B we have to mark as 0,
       so that it is not counted again(ex: B = aab)
       nm = search  substring with  String A
       
       
 2)  we have to optimize ,
     nm = can be reduced as the string contains charcters froom [a-z] ,
     if we can maintain count array and compare for the count
         such that all chcraters in A are in B Count array
         
       m + n*n(n+26), 26 + 26   | m = count array of A , n = count array populating subString , 26 for compare count arrays.
       
 3) carry forward count for sub array ( n  -> 1)
      m + n*n(1+26), 26+26
      
 4)if we find a valid substring , from 0 to say some index x , 
 there might be a possibility that its also a valid from 1 to x .
 
 From p1=0 find some p2. where you can find  vslid substring containing all characters,
 From there move p1 and p2 rest of the array accordingly.
 
 (n+n)* 26 + m , 26+26 | n->p1 , n ->p2
