Given an array of integers of size N and a window size K. For each continuous window of size K, find the highest element in the window. 
Output the sum of the highest element of all the windows.

Brute force : 1) find the max in each window and add it to sum, k*(n-k+1)

carry forward : as we need to find max in each window,as window moves forward there is only one element entering or leaving,
