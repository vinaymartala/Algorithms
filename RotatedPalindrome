Check if given string is a rotated palindrome or not
http://www.techiedelight.com/check-given-string-rotated-palindrome-not/

1)naive :
 for each possible rotation check if it is a palindrome.
 str = str.substring(1) + str.charAt(0); so on
 o(n      *     n/2)         , 1 
  rotation     palindrome check
  
2)CBAABCD -  If string is a palindrome , you will have two same letters  side by side like AA.
             1) after finding AA expand on left and right to check if its palindrome.
             2)if not proceed further,
             
             corner case: ABCDCBA, if given string is a palindrome expand from first and last towards center.
             
  o(n * n/2) ,1          
             
3) Concantenate string to itself S+S, and use find longest palindrome substring with length as string length.
  Start from first element and expand both sides for odd length and even length ,
