Given an array of integers of size N and a window size K. For each continuous window of size K, find the highest element in the window. 
Output the sum of the highest element of all the windows.( page -71)

Brute force : 1) find the max in each window and add it to sum, k*(n-k+1)

2) as we need to find max in each window,as window moves forward there is only one element entering or leaving.
We need to maintain order as well as count (as there may be duplicates) - ordered Map
 n*(log k + log k +log k), k (map) - have to check for remove
